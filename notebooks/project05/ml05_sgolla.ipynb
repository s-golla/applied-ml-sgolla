    "**Introduction:**   \n",
    "This project explores the power of ensemble methods in machine learning by applying them to the Red Wine Quality dataset, a classification task where we predict the discrete quality score (from 3 to 8). We will establish a baseline using a single Decision Tree and then implement various ensemble techniques, including boosting (AdaBoost), bagging (Random Forest), and a heterogeneous ensemble (Voting Classifier), along with a standard Neural Network (MLP). Our goal is to determine which model strategy provides the best predictive performance and generalization capability."
