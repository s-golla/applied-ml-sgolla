For example, a company may want to predict the fuel efficiency of a car based on its weight and engine size or estimate home prices based on square footage and location. Regression analysis helps identify and quantify these relationships between numerical features, providing insights that can be used for forecasting and decision-making.</p> <p>This project demonstrates your ability to apply regression modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. You will: - Load and explore a dataset. - Choose and justify features for predicting a target variable. - Train a regression model and evaluate performance. - Compare multiple regression approaches. - Document your work in a structured Jupyter Notebook.</p>"},{"location":"project01/#dataset","title":"Dataset","text":"<p>Housing Prices Dataset (Predict home values based on features like square footage and location) - We use the built-in dataset from scikit-learn:    - <code>from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing</code> - Additional dataset available on Kaggle:    - Kaggle Housing Prices </p>"},{"location":"project01/#python-library-for-machine-learning-scikit-learn","title":"Python Library for Machine Learning: scikit-learn","text":"<p>We use scikit-learn, built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib    - Read more at https://scikit-learn.org/    - Scikit-learn supports classification, regression, and clustering.    - This project applies regression.</p>"},{"location":"project01/#professional-python-setup-and-workflow","title":"Professional Python Setup and Workflow","text":"<p>We follow professional Python practices.
